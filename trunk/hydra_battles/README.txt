Hydra Battles
------------

2-player RTS (real-time strategy) game. You play on the same screen, gathering resources and attacking the other player, and also drawing lines to hinder the other player movement.

Like in a classic RTS games, you have headquarters, you command peasants to gather resources (wood), you can build buildings (barracks) and train soldiers and command them to attack. It is a strategy (how to divide your resources, what to build/train), and it's real-time (time flies regardless what you do).

Then, there's a twist, specific for a touch screen. When you command a peasant or soldier to go somewhere, you draw a line on a screen. This line cannot be crossed by other commands. This way you may make it difficult for other player (and yourself) to make other commands (to gather resources or attack you).

Graphics: isometric graphics from OGA.

You can play in "free for all" mode (faction_exclusive_moves = false in game.xml) where both players can move all the time. Note that the game works on Android with multi-touch, playing on a large touch screen is very comfortable. Or you can play with faction_exclusive_moves = true, where each player has 10 seconds to performs his/her move. The latter is useful to play on PC with a single mouse.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy hints:

At the beginning, you do not have any buildings or npcs. Your only move is to build an HQ (drag the "Build HQ" icon), and then train a peasant (click on HQ). Then you can instruct the peasant to gather wood, and eventually you will be able to train more peasants or build barracts (that in turn will allow to train soldiers).

Costs: see game.xml for now.
